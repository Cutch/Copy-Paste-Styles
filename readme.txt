Copy and Paste Gutenberg blocks and styles.

== Description ==

Using either ctrl+c and ctrl+shift+v (Configurable from settings), or the the copy styles button in the block editor. Copy and paste the type and styles from one block to another.

= Features =
 - Convert to blocks which do not have a direct conversion
 - Copy styles from multiple blocks to another set of blocks, or one block to many
 - Retain block attributes during conversion. Ex. h6 for headings, or css classes.


== Frequently asked questions ==

= Can use this on multiple blocks =

Yes, you can copy from and paste to any number of blocks.

= Will this work on custom or abnormal blocks =

If the custom blocks supports the transformation from a core block it may work. Otherwise, it does the best it can.
However, I wouldn't expect text to turn into images. If there are some cases that are missing or a block its not working for, post it here [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Cutch/copy-blocky/issues).
